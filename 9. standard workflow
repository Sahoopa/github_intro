-1. clone a remote repository
git clone <clone repo name>

-2. Check which branch you are on.
git branch

-3. create a new branch to work on your functionality
git checkout -b <branch name>

-4. Make changes to specific functionality.

-5. Add these changes to staging area
git add -A
git status

-6. Commit these changes with proper message
git commit -m "Changed functionality - main function"
git status

-7. Push these changes to <branch name>
git push origin <branch name> 

-8. Check which branch you are on.
git branch -a

-----You have pushed the changes from your local to remote repo.

---- In case you want to merge the changes to master branch, you can follow on.
-9. Now checkout the master branch, as we want to merge the changes to master
git checkout master

-10. Always pull the remote branch before pushing the changes to remote repo.
git pull origin master
git branch --merged

-11. Merge origin to <branch name>
git merge <brach name>

-12. Finally push the changes to master
git push origin master

------Ideally its a good practice to delete the branch on local and remote. Next steps are to delete the local and remote branch.
-13. Delete local <branch name>
git branch --merged
git branch -d <branch name>

-14.Delete the <branch name> from remote repo.
git branch -a
git push origin -delete <branch name>
git branch -a
